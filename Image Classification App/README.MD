## Image Classification Application, Neural Network using numpy
    - Used a collection of images containing cats to perform image classification.
    - Numpy was used to built a neural network from scratch.
    - Implemented different optimizers such as Gradient Descent, Mini batch Gradient Descent and Adam to classify the images containing cat and achieved an accuracy of 0.8 with Adam Optimizer.
    - Built an application where user uploads an image and the model will classify whether it contains an image or not using streamlit.
