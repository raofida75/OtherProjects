## Image Classification Application, Neural Network using numpy
- Used a collection of images containing cats to perform image classification.
- Numpy was used to built a neural network from scratch.
- Implemented different optimizers such as Gradient Descent, Mini batch Gradient Descent and Adam to classify the images containing cat and achieved an accuracy of 0.8 with Adam Optimizer.
- Built an application where user uploads an image and the model will classify whether it contains an image or not using streamlit.
