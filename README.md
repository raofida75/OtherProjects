## Background

Hello! 

My name is Fida Hussain Rao,  welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I am currently pursuing Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at Ned University Karachi. I shifted to Data science in my sophomore year when I started learning programming for my university course. Realizing the interest I developed in learning programming, I further explored Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
